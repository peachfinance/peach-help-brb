### How do I change my email and mobile notifications?

You can change your email and text notifications:
1. Sign in to your account.
2. Navigate to *Account settings*.
3. If you don’t want to receive text messages, uncheck *Receive text messages about my loan* next to your *Mobile Phone* number.
4. If you don’t want to receive email payment reminders when your loan is *current*, check *Don’t send payment reminders when my loan is current*.

Keep in mind, we can’t stop email notifications about regulatory information, payments status and overdue loans.
