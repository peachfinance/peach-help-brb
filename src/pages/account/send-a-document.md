### How do I send a document to the customer support?

To securely upload and send documents:
1. Sign in to your account.
2. Navigate to *Account settings*.
3. Scroll to the *Upload documents* section and click or tap on *Upload document(s)*.

To keep your personal information safe, documents will not be accessible after you successfully upload them. Our customer support team will review them internally. 

We cannot receive documents as attachments to emails. 

If you need to mail physical documents, please use the address located in the <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> page.
