### How do I submit a CCPA privacy request?

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) allows California residents to:
- Opt out of marketing
- Request a copy of personal data we have on file about you
- Request that we delete this data
- Opt out of having your personal data sold to third parties

Our responses to requests may be limited due to exceptions under the CCPA that relate to financial data.  For example, due to financial regulations, we arenâ€™t able to delete some data related to your account or loans. We are not using cookies to track your activity on the website.
