### How do I get a refund?

If your refund amount is less than your outstanding balance, it might not lower your upcoming payment. Instead, you can expect fewer scheduled payments, a smaller final payment, or both.

If your refund amount is more than your outstanding balance, you’ll get back the difference. We’ll send you a reimbursement to your bank account on file within 3-10 business days. If you don’t have a valid bank account you can <a href="/payments/manage-payment-methods/">add one</a>. You may also request to receive the reimbursement as a check mailed to your home address.
