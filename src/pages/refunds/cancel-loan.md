### How do I cancel my loan?

You may cancel your loan at any time prior to your first session with your training provider by sending a written email request to [support@brb-borrower.peach-sandbox.finance](mailto:support@brb-borrower.peach-sandbox.finance). After your first class with your training provider we cannot cancel your loan unless there was a confirmed fraud case. You may still request a refund from the training provider directly and can find more information in the <a href="/refunds/get-a-refund/">
refund section</a>.

You can pay your loan early. We donâ€™t charge any fees or penalties for prepayments.
