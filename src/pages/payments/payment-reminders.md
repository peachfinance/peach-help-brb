### When payment reminders are sent?

We’ll send you payment reminders 3 days before each due date. If you don’t want to receive reminders on your loans in a good status, you can <a href="/account/notification-preferences/">update your notification preferences</a>.

If your loan has an overdue balance, we’ll send you additional reminders.
