### What happens if I pay more than the amount that is due?

If you pay more than the amount that is due, the extra amount goes toward your loan balance. If your loan is current, an extra amount is normally applied toward the loan principal. As a result you can expect fewer scheduled payments, a smaller final payment, or both.
