### How can I pay by check?

Checks may take up to 10 business days to process. If you want a faster way to pay you can use a <a href="/payments/manage-payment-methods/">
bank account (ACH) or a debit card</a>.

To pay with a check:

1. You must submit one check for one loan only. If you have multiple loans, please mail multiple checks.
2. Write on the check:

   * Your loan ID.
   * Your username or email address that is associated with your account.
3. Make the check payable to:\
   **Peach Finance Inc.**
4. Mail the check to:\
   **490 43rd Street #10**\
   **Oakland, CA 94609**

If you forget to include the loan ID, your payment will go toward the oldest active loan. If your check is higher than the outstanding balance, your loan will be paid off and youâ€™ll receive a <a href="/payments/reimbursment-status/">reimbursement</a> for the difference.
