###  What can I do if my loan has been changed off?

We may charge off your loan if you stopped making payments for a few months.

If your loan was charged off, it may have been sent to a debt collection agency. To get the debt collection agency details you can sign in to your account and select the charged off loan. The details will be shown at the top of the loan details page.
