### How do I turn on/off automatic payments (Autopay)?

You can make automatic payments by turning on Autopay. Autopay automatically debits your payment from a selected payment method, debit card or bank account, on each Autopay due date. Autopay can be aligned with loan payment due dates or more frequent.

#### Turn on Autopay
1. Sign in to your account.
2. Choose a loan you want to turn on Autopay.
3. Click or tap on *Enable Autopay* or *Loan options⟶Manage Autopay*.
4. Select frequency and a payment method. If your payment method is not listed, you need first to add it. See how to add a new <a href="/payments/manage-payment-methods/">payment method</a>.
5. Review the payment schedule and *Autopay Consent*.
6. Click or tap on *Set Autopay*.
7, You will also receive an email with the Autopay details.

Autopay won’t automatically debit an overdue amount. To pay that amount, please make or schedule a <a href="/payments/make-payment">one-time payment</a> on your loan.

#### Update Autopay
1. Sign in to your account.
2. Choose a loan you want to turn on Autopay.
3. Click or tap on *Loan options⟶Manage Autopay*.
4. Select a new frequency or another payment method.
5. Review updated *Autopay Consent*.
6. Click or tap on *Update Autopay*.
7. You will also receive an email with the updated Autopay details.

#### Turn off Autopay
1. Sign in to your account.
2. Choose a loan you want to turn on Autopay.
3. Click or tap on *Loan options⟶Manage Autopay*.
4. Click or tap on *Turn off Autopay*.

Autopay payments that were already processed cannot be cancelled. To stop an Autopay payment that was not processed yet, you need to turn off Autopay 24 hours before the payment date.
