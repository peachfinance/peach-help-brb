###  How do I get my money back if I paid by accident?

#### One-time payment
Please <a href="/contact-us/">contact us</a> if you made an online payment that you didn’t mean to make. Payment reversal requests must be made no more than 3 business days after you submit the payment.

We are not always able to reverse a payment due to limitations with payment processors, banking institutions, and  card networks.

If possible, we’ll reverse the full amount of the payment after it has been processed. You should receive the funds in your bank account or on your debit card in 5-10 business days, depending on your financial institution.

#### Future payment
You can cancel a scheduled payment if it was not processed yet, normally up to 24 hours before the payment date. To cancel a future payment:
1. Sign in to your account.
2. Choose a loan.
3. In the *Activity* tab, find the future payment date and the amount.
4. Click or tap on “⌄” to see the payment details.
5. Click or tap on *Cancel*.

#### Autopay
You can stop an automatic payment if it was not processed yet, normally up to 24 hours before the payment date. See how to <a href="/payments/turn-on-autopay/">turn off Autopay</a>.
