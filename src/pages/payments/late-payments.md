### When payment reminders are sent?

If you experience a financial hardship, please <a href="">learn about your options</a>.

If you are going to be late on a payment or your payment failed, please sign in to your account and schedule a payment as soon as possible. 

We don’t charge late fees.

After you schedule a payment, you’ll continue to receive reminders by email and/or text messages but you won’t receive collection calls.
